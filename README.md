When everything is done every training run should end up zipped in the named folders so that you can setup my training run with your own primer.mid file. Those folders should also include the .mid file output as well as a converted output to .mp3



The All-inputs folder has the 2 midi file inputs (a-few-of-my-favorite-things.mid and god-rest-ye-merry-gentlemen.mid) and fur-elise.mid as the primer.mid file

Please make Pull Requests with the same folder labelling scheme

midi2.LAYERS.TRAINING

Obviously we are going to do runs with more than two midi files but I needed to make things simple here to look for patterns.
